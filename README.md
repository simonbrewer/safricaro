Estimates of runoff and evaporation for Southern Africa.

Three methods to be used:

- WASMOD-M runoff estimates (from Widen-Nilsson, 2007)
- SPLASHF estimates with Miller runoff calculations
- SPLASHF estimates with WBMplus detention pool runoff estimates

Estimates based on CRU 10m climatology, converted to NetCDF files.
